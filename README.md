I have analyze the U.S. Department of Education's College Scorecard dataset.

Your task is to come up with an interesting question to ask about the dataset which can then be answered using:

visualizations
summary statistics
either inference or modeling
The rest of these instructions describe the dataset and what should go into your report. In addition there is a checklist at end of this document that summarizes what you need to include in your report.

About the Dataset
You will be working with the College Scorecard dataset started by The Obama Administration in September 2015. Each row in this dataset contains information about a college in the USA.

The dataset is quite large (13.5 MB), and so cannot be distributed via GitHub. You need to download the dataset and upload it to RStudio's folder for this project. Once you have done so, it will loaded by default in the setup block of the final_project.Rmd file where you will write your report (the variable name of the dataset is college).

Because the dataset is so large, you will find it almost impossible to open in a tab in RStudio. Please do not try to open the college dataframe in RStudio - your RStudio will freeze up. Instead, you will have to rely on a table describing all the columns in the dataset. This is called a data dictionary, and is available as a Google Docs spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YrYiJ-J9rLhs4Qf5OCvHGMyUFyMKOMtMuGmpyt47mEY/edit?usp=sharing.


This project is built around asking an interesting question about the dataset.

Your project report should contain the following sections:

Introduction
Preprocessing
Visualization
Summary Statistics
Data Analysis
Conclusions
